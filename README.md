### Description
R8R (rater) is a simple-to-use, no nonsense movie rating service. This was made for a school project for CIS 371 - Web Applications Programming at Grand Valley State University. This website is not ready for public use, as we ran out of time to get everything done that we wanted to (like search functionality). It is also not hosted anywhere, but you can see screenshots below
